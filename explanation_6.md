Explanation for Problem 6

I have chosen to employ a straightforward algorithm that iterates through all elements of array and keeps track of min and max. The algorithm satisfies O(n) constraint and does this in a single recursion as expected.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) since the array is traversed once through the loop.
